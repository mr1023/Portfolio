# Portfolio
These projects sought (still do in the company) to provide a solution to a problem. 
My main interest was (is) to get data, orderly, and automate as much as possible to focus on things that could not (yet) be automated or required more attention.
Some problems were more challenging than others, and the satisfaction of watching them run smoothly was proportional to the size problem.
